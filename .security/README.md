# Security Directory

## Purpose
The `.security` directory contains all security-related configurations, checks, and documentation for the Legal Study System.

## Structure
- `access_control/`: Access control policies and implementations
- `authentication/`: Authentication mechanisms and configurations
- `authorization/`: Authorization rules and policies
- `encryption/`: Encryption configurations and key management
- `audit/`: Audit logging configurations and policies
- `compliance/`: Compliance documentation and checks
- `vulnerability/`: Vulnerability scanning and management
- `incident_response/`: Incident response procedures and documentation

## Security Checklist
- [ ] Authentication system implementation
- [ ] Authorization rules definition
- [ ] Access control policies
- [ ] Encryption configuration
- [ ] Audit logging setup
- [ ] Compliance documentation
- [ ] Vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Incident response procedures

- [ ] Security monitoring setup

## Guidelines
1. All security configurations must be documented
2. Regular security audits are required
3. Security incidents must be logged and reviewed
4. Access control must be implemented at all levels
5. Encryption must be used for sensitive data
6. Regular vulnerability scanning is mandatory
7. Security testing must be comprehensive
8. Incident response procedures must be tested
