## Next Steps:
1. Set up base test infrastructure
2. Create mock services
3. Implement test data management
4. Configure test environments
5. Write initial tests
6. Set up automation
7. Configure monitoring
8. Create documentation

## Notes:
- All tests must be automated
- Tests must be reliable
- Tests must be maintainable
- Tests must be fast
- Coverage must be tracked
- Results must be reported
- Trends must be monitored
- Quality must be enforced
