## Next Steps:
1. Set up refactoring analysis infrastructure
2. Implement code analysis tools
3. Create performance analysis tools
4. Develop security analysis tools
5. Set up documentation tools
6. Implement continuous refactoring
7. Set up monitoring and reporting
8. Document refactoring procedures

## Notes:
- All refactoring must be thoroughly tested
- Documentation must be kept up to date
- Performance must be monitored
- Security must be maintained
- Code quality must be improved
- Maintainability must be enhanced
- Continuous improvement is required
- Innovation should be encouraged
