# Health Check Command Security Checklist

## Authentication and Authorization
- [ ] Verify that health check endpoints require appropriate authentication
- [ ] Ensure that only authorized users/roles can access detailed health information
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for health check requests
- [ ] Add audit logging for health check access
- [ ] Validate authentication tokens before processing requests

## Input Validation
- [ ] Validate all command-line arguments
- [ ] Sanitize any user-provided input before processing
- [ ] Implement strict type checking for all parameters
- [ ] Validate configuration file contents
- [ ] Check for malicious input patterns

## Information Security
- [ ] Ensure sensitive information is not exposed in health check output
- [ ] Mask or redact sensitive data in error messages
- [ ] Implement appropriate logging levels to prevent data leakage
- [ ] Secure storage of health check reports
- [ ] Control access to detailed error information

## Service Security
- [ ] Verify service authentication before collecting metrics
- [ ] Implement timeouts for service connections
- [ ] Handle service authentication failures gracefully
- [ ] Monitor for suspicious service behavior
- [ ] Implement service access controls

## Network Security
- [ ] Ensure secure communication between services
- [ ] Implement TLS for all service connections
- [ ] Validate service endpoints
- [ ] Monitor for network-level attacks
- [ ] Implement network timeout handling

## Error Handling
- [ ] Implement secure error handling
- [ ] Prevent error message information leakage
- [ ] Log security-related errors appropriately
- [ ] Handle service errors securely
- [ ] Implement fallback mechanisms for critical failures

## Configuration Security
- [ ] Secure storage of service credentials
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive configuration data
- [ ] Implement secure configuration loading
- [ ] Validate configuration integrity
- [ ] Monitor for configuration changes

## Monitoring and Alerting
- [ ] Implement security event monitoring
- [ ] Set up alerts for suspicious activity
- [ ] Monitor for brute force attempts
- [ ] Track authentication failures
- [ ] Alert on unusual error patterns

## Compliance
- [ ] Ensure GDPR compliance in health data collection
- [ ] Implement data retention policies
- [ ] Maintain audit trails
- [ ] Follow security best practices
- [ ] Regular security reviews

## Dependencies
- [ ] Regular security updates for dependencies
- [ ] Vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Dependency version control
- [ ] Security patch management
- [ ] Third-party security compliance

## Testing
- [ ] Regular security testing
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] Security regression testing
- [ ] Vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Security benchmark testing

## Documentation

## Vulnerability Management

### Known Vulnerabilities
None reported

### Risk Assessment
- Authentication: Medium Risk
- Authorization: Medium Risk
- Information Disclosure: Low Risk
- Service Security: Low Risk
- Configuration Security: Low Risk

### Mitigation Plan
1. Implement authentication system
2. Add authorization checks
3. Enhance security monitoring
4. Implement audit logging
5. Regular security reviews

## Security Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- [ ] Weekly dependency updates

- [ ] Quarterly penetration testing
- [ ] Annual security audit
- [ ] Continuous vulnerability scanning

### Emergency Procedures
1. Security incident response
2. Emergency patching
3. Service isolation
4. Incident reporting
5. Recovery procedures
