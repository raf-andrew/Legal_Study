## Next Steps:
1. Complete middleware implementations
2. Implement input sanitization
3. Set up security monitoring
4. Configure security logging
5. Complete security documentation
6. Implement remaining tests
7. Set up audit system
8. Configure alerting

## Notes:
- All security implementations must follow best practices
- Security measures must be thoroughly tested
- Documentation must be comprehensive
- Logging must be properly secured
- Monitoring must be real-time
- Alerts must be properly configured
- Regular security audits required
- Security training must be provided
