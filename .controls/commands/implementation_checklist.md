## Files to Create:
- [ ] `.controls/commands/base.py` - Base command implementation
- [ ] `.controls/commands/registry.py` - Command registry implementation
- [ ] `.controls/commands/executor.py` - Command execution implementation
- [ ] `.controls/unit/test_base_command.py` - Base command unit tests
- [ ] `.controls/unit/test_command_registry.py` - Command registry unit tests
- [ ] `.controls/unit/test_command_executor.py` - Command executor unit tests
- [ ] `.controls/integration/test_command_flow.py` - Command flow integration tests
- [ ] `.controls/security/command_security.md` - Command security documentation
- [ ] `.controls/guide/command_usage.md` - Command usage documentation
- [ ] `.controls/api/command_api.md` - Command API documentation

## Next Steps:
1. Implement base command infrastructure
2. Create command registry
3. Implement command executor
4. Write unit tests
5. Write integration tests
6. Create documentation
7. Implement security measures
8. Set up monitoring and logging

## Notes:
- All implementations must follow SOLID principles
- All code must be fully tested
- All security measures must be implemented
- All documentation must be complete
- All monitoring must be in place
- All logging must be implemented
- All validation must be thorough
- All examples must be provided
