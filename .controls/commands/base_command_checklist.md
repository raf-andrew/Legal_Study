## Next Steps:
1. Implement security layer for commands
2. Create integration tests
3. Complete documentation
4. Implement command executor
5. Add security monitoring and logging

## Notes:
- All implementations must follow SOLID principles
- All code must be fully tested
- All security measures must be implemented
- All documentation must be complete
- All monitoring must be in place
- All logging must be implemented
- All validation must be thorough
- All examples must be provided
