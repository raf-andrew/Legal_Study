# Testing Framework Research

## Overview
This document tracks our research and decisions regarding the testing framework implementation.

## Key Libraries and Tools

### Testing Frameworks
- pytest: Primary testing framework
  - pytest-asyncio: For async testing
  - pytest-cov: For code coverage
  - pytest-mock: For mocking
  - pytest-timeout: For timeout testing

### Chaos Engineering
- chaoslib: For chaos testing
- chaosmesh: For Kubernetes chaos testing
- chaos-monkey: For resilience testing

### Security Testing
- bandit: For security scanning
- safety: For dependency security
- snyk: For vulnerability scanning
- OWASP ZAP: For web security testing

### Performance Testing
- locust: For load testing
- k6: For performance testing
- JMeter: For comprehensive load testing

### Documentation
- Sphinx: For documentation generation
- OpenAPI/Swagger: For API documentation
- MkDocs: For project documentation

## Implementation Decisions

### Test Structure
1. Unit Tests
   - Location: `tests/unit/`
   - Focus: Individual components
   - Coverage: 80% minimum

2. Integration Tests
   - Location: `tests/integration/`
   - Focus: Component interactions
   - Coverage: 60% minimum

3. Chaos Tests
   - Location: `tests/chaos/`
   - Focus: System resilience
   - Coverage: Critical paths only

4. ACID Tests
   - Location: `tests/acid/`
   - Focus: Data consistency
   - Coverage: All data operations

5. Smoke Tests
   - Location: `tests/smoke/`
   - Focus: Basic functionality
   - Coverage: Core features

### Error Handling
- All errors logged to `.errors/`
- Error categorization:
  - Critical: System failure
  - High: Major functionality impact
  - Medium: Minor functionality impact
  - Low: Cosmetic or non-critical

### Test Data Management
- Test data stored in `tests/data/`
- Separate environments:
  - Development
  - Staging
  - Production
- Data anonymization for sensitive information

### Continuous Integration
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Automated test runs on:
  - Pull requests
  - Main branch commits
  - Scheduled runs
- Test result reporting to dashboard

## Open Questions
1. Should we implement custom chaos testing tools or use existing ones?
2. How to handle test data for different environments?
3. What metrics should we track for test effectiveness?
4. How to balance test coverage with execution time?

## Next Steps
1. Set up basic test infrastructure
2. Implement core test cases
3. Configure CI/CD pipeline
4. Establish monitoring and reporting
5. Document test procedures
