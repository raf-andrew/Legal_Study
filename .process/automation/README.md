This directory contains documentation for all automation processes, including CI/CD, testing, and deployment automation.

## Automation Workflows

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline
- Location: [`.github/workflows/`](.github/workflows/)
- Process:
  1. Code commit
  2. Automated testing
  3. Code quality checks
  4. Security scanning
  5. Build process
  6. Deployment

### 2. Testing Automation
- Location: [`tests/`](tests/)
- Process:
  1. Test case creation
  2. Test automation
  3. Test execution
  4. Results analysis
  5. Report generation
  6. Documentation

### 3. Deployment Automation
- Location: [`deployment/`](deployment/)
- Process:
  1. Environment setup
  2. Configuration management
  3. Deployment execution
  4. Verification
  5. Rollback procedures
  6. Documentation

## Automation Templates

### CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          pytest tests/
```

### Deployment Configuration
```yaml
name: Deployment
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: |
          # Deployment steps
          echo "Deploying to production"
```
