# Job Sublist Generation Template

## Context
[Brief description of the parent job and its requirements]

## Objective
Break down a job component into detailed, actionable sublists with clear completion criteria.

## Required Information
### Parent Job Details
- Job ID
- Component being broken down
- Dependencies
- Quality requirements

### Resource Requirements
- Required materials
- Access needs
- Tool requirements
- Reference materials

## Development Process
1. Component Analysis
   - Identify core requirements
   - List dependencies
   - Note quality criteria
   - Document constraints

2. Task Breakdown
   - List primary tasks
   - Identify subtasks
   - Note dependencies
   - Set priorities

3. Resource Mapping
   - Match tasks to resources
   - Identify gaps
   - List requirements
   - Note constraints

4. Quality Integration
   - Define checkpoints
   - List criteria
   - Specify evidence
   - Note validations

## Output Structure
### 1. Task Hierarchy
```markdown
1. Main Task
   1.1. Subtask
        - Action item
        - Quality check
   1.2. Subtask
        - Action item
        - Quality check
```

### 2. Resource Requirements
```markdown
- Required Resources:
  - Type: [Resource type]
  - Purpose: [Usage]
  - Source: [Where to obtain]
  - Alternative: [Backup option]
```

### 3. Quality Checklist
```markdown
[ ] Quality Point 1
    - Evidence: [What demonstrates completion]
    - Validation: [How to verify]
[ ] Quality Point 2
    - Evidence: [What demonstrates completion]
    - Validation: [How to verify]
```

## Success Criteria
- All tasks have clear actions
- Resources are identified
- Dependencies are noted
- Quality checks are defined
- Timeline is realistic

## Integration Points
- Link to parent job
- Connect to QA process
- Note dependencies
- Track progress

## Notes
- Consider sequence
- Note blockers
- Document assumptions
- Track changes
