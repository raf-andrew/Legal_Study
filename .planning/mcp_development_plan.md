# MCP Server Development Plan

## Overview
The Master Control Program (MCP) server will be a parallel system within Laravel that provides agentic capabilities and development assistance. It will operate independently but integrate seamlessly with the core framework.

## Core Components

### 1. Service Discovery System
- Automatic service detection
- Service type classification
- Method discovery
- Metadata collection
- Service health monitoring

### 2. Event Bus System
- Publish/subscribe pattern
- Event history tracking
- Event filtering
- Error handling
- Performance monitoring

### 3. Configuration Management
- Environment-aware configuration
- Configuration validation
- Security settings
- Feature flags
- Performance tuning

### 4. Agent System
- Agent lifecycle management
- Task delegation
- Result aggregation
- Error handling
- Performance monitoring

### 5. Development Interface
- Command-line interface
- API endpoints
- Web interface
- Debug tools
- Performance metrics
