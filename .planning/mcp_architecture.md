# MCP Server Architecture

## Overview
The MCP (Master Control Program) server is designed to provide agentic capabilities and development assistance within the platform. It operates in parallel to the core framework and provides a comprehensive interface for development and platform control.

## Core Components

### 1. MCP Server Core
- **Service Provider**: Manages registration and lifecycle of MCP services
- **Configuration Manager**: Handles environment-specific settings and feature flags
- **Security Manager**: Controls access and authentication
- **Event Bus**: Manages communication between components

### 2. Agentic System
- **Agent Registry**: Manages agent registration and capabilities
- **Action Queue**: Handles agent action requests and execution
- **State Manager**: Tracks agent and system state
- **Coordination Engine**: Manages agent interactions and resource allocation

### 3. Development Interface
- **Command Interface**: Provides CLI and API access to MCP features
- **Development Mode**: Enables/disables development features based on environment
- **Debug Tools**: Provides debugging and monitoring capabilities
- **Utility Services**: Common development utilities and helpers

### 4. Platform Integration
- **Service Discovery**: Automatically detects and registers platform services
- **Service Actuator**: Provides control over platform services
- **Event Handler**: Manages platform events and triggers
- **Monitoring System**: Tracks service health and performance

## Security Architecture

### 1. Authentication
- JWT-based authentication
- API key management
- Role-based access control

### 2. Authorization
- Fine-grained permission system
- Service-level access controls
- Environment-based restrictions

### 3. Communication Security
- TLS encryption
- Message signing
- Secure channel establishment

## Development Features

### 1. Agentic Capabilities
- Service discovery and control
- Automated testing and validation
- Development assistance
- Platform monitoring and management

### 2. Development Tools
- Code generation
- Testing automation
- Performance profiling
- Debugging utilities

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Testing
- Component-level tests
- Mock-based testing
- Coverage requirements

### 2. Integration Testing
- Service interaction tests
- End-to-end workflows
- Performance benchmarks

### 3. Security Testing
- Authentication tests
- Authorization validation
- Security scanning

## Deployment Considerations

### 1. Environment Configuration
- Development mode settings
- Production restrictions
- Feature flags

### 2. Monitoring
- Health checks
- Performance metrics
- Error tracking

### 3. Maintenance
- Update procedures
- Backup strategies
- Rollback plans
