## Core User Journeys

### 1. System Initialization

#### Epic: System Setup
1. **Authentication**
   ```gherkin
   Given I am a system administrator
   When I access the system
   Then I should be able to authenticate securely
   ```

2. **Component Selection**
   ```gherkin
   Given I am authenticated
   When I start initialization
   Then I should be able to select components to initialize
   And I should see component dependencies
   ```

3. **Configuration Validation**
   ```gherkin
   Given I have selected components
   When I proceed with initialization
   Then the system should validate configurations
   And show any validation errors
   ```

4. **Progress Monitoring**
   ```gherkin
   Given initialization has started
   When components are being initialized
   Then I should see real-time progress
   And receive notifications of completion or errors
   ```

### 2. Service Management

#### Epic: Service Control
1. **Service Overview**
   ```gherkin
   Given I am authenticated
   When I access the service dashboard
   Then I should see all services and their status
   ```

2. **Service Control**
   ```gherkin
   Given I am viewing a service
   When I need to control the service
   Then I should be able to start/stop/restart
   And see immediate status updates
   ```

3. **Health Monitoring**
   ```gherkin
   Given a service is running
   When I check its health
   Then I should see health metrics
   And any warning indicators
   ```

4. **Log Access**
   ```gherkin
   Given I am troubleshooting
   When I need to view logs
   Then I should see filtered log entries
   And be able to search/export logs
   ```

### 3. Configuration Management

#### Epic: System Configuration
1. **Configuration Editing**
   ```gherkin
   Given I am authorized
   When I edit configurations
   Then I should have a schema-aware editor
   And see validation in real-time
   ```

2. **Version Control**
   ```gherkin
   Given I make configuration changes
   When I save them
   Then they should be versioned
   And I should be able to rollback
   ```

3. **Template Management**
   ```gherkin
   Given I need to create configurations
   When I use templates
   Then I should see predefined options
   And be able to customize them
   ```

### 4. Monitoring & Alerts

#### Epic: System Monitoring
1. **Dashboard View**
   ```gherkin
   Given I am authenticated
   When I access the dashboard
   Then I should see system overview
   And key performance indicators
   ```

2. **Alert Configuration**
   ```gherkin
   Given I am setting up monitoring
   When I configure alerts
   Then I should be able to define conditions
   And specify notification channels
   ```

3. **Metric Analysis**
   ```gherkin
   Given I am analyzing performance
   When I view metrics
   Then I should see historical data
   And be able to export reports
   ```
