# Load Testing Simulation

This simulation tests the platform's performance under various load conditions to ensure it can handle expected user traffic and data processing requirements.

## Objectives

1. Measure system performance under different load conditions
2. Identify performance bottlenecks
3. Determine system capacity limits
4. Validate scalability requirements
5. Generate performance metrics and recommendations

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Concurrent Users
- Tests with varying numbers of simultaneous users (10-1000)
- Measures response times and throughput
- Validates user experience under load

### 2. Request Types
- Tests different API endpoints
- Validates all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Measures performance per request type

### 3. Data Sizes
- Tests with different payload sizes
- Validates data processing capabilities
- Measures throughput for different data volumes

## Metrics Collected

1. Response Times
   - Average response time
   - Response time percentiles (p50, p75, p90, p95, p99)
   - Maximum and minimum response times

2. Throughput
   - Requests per second
   - Data processed per second
   - Success/failure rates

3. Resource Usage
   - CPU utilization
   - Memory usage
   - System resource trends

4. Error Rates
   - Overall error rate
   - Error distribution by request type
   - Error patterns under load

## Success Criteria

1. Response Time
   - P95 < 500ms
   - P99 < 1000ms
   - No timeouts

2. Throughput
   - Sustained 1000 requests/second
   - Linear scaling up to target load

3. Error Rate
   - < 1% error rate under normal load
   - < 5% error rate under peak load

4. Resource Usage
   - CPU usage < 80%
   - Memory usage < 85%
   - No resource exhaustion

## Usage

Run the simulation using the master runner:

```bash
python run_simulations.py --category data_processing --type load_testing
```

Or run directly:

```bash
python load_test.py
```

## Reports

Reports are generated in JSON format and include:
- Test configuration
- Raw metrics
- Analysis results
- Performance recommendations

Reports are stored in:
```
.simulations/reports/data_processing/load_testing/
```

## Integration Points

1. System Monitoring
   - Metrics collection
   - Resource monitoring
   - Alert triggering

2. Performance Analysis
   - Trend analysis
   - Bottleneck identification
   - Capacity planning

3. CI/CD Pipeline
   - Automated testing
   - Performance regression detection
   - Release validation

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- Logging system
- Metrics collection system
- Resource monitoring system
