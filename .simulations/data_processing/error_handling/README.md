# Error Handling Simulation

This simulation tests the platform's error handling capabilities, including error detection, recovery strategies, and reporting mechanisms.

## Objectives

1. Test error detection mechanisms
2. Validate recovery strategies
3. Measure recovery performance
4. Evaluate reporting accuracy
5. Generate error handling metrics

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Error Types
- Validation Errors (20% probability)
- Network Errors (10% probability)
- Database Errors (5% probability)
- Permission Errors (15% probability)
- Resource Errors (10% probability)
- Business Logic Errors (20% probability)
- System Errors (5% probability)

### 2. Error Severity
- LOW: Minor issues, minimal impact
- MEDIUM: Moderate issues, partial functionality
- HIGH: Major issues, significant impact
- CRITICAL: Severe issues, system failure

### 3. Recovery Strategies
- Retry with backoff
- Failover to alternate systems
- Escalation procedures
- Manual intervention

## Test Operations

1. Data Processing
   - Data validation
   - Format conversion
   - Data transformation
   - Error detection

2. User Authentication
   - Credential validation
   - Permission checks
   - Session management
   - Access control

3. Resource Allocation
   - Resource requests
   - Capacity checks
   - Resource release
   - Conflict resolution

4. Business Transactions
   - Transaction validation
   - State management
   - Rollback procedures
   - Consistency checks

5. System Maintenance
   - Health checks
   - Resource cleanup
   - System updates
   - Error recovery

## Recovery Methods

### 1. Retry Strategy
- Maximum 3 attempts
- Exponential backoff
- Configurable delays
- Success tracking

### 2. Failover Strategy
- Alternate routes
- Backup systems
- Mirror instances
- Quick switching

### 3. Escalation Strategy
- Multiple levels
- Timeout controls
- Emergency procedures
- Manual intervention

## Success Criteria

1. Error Detection
   - 100% detection rate
   - Correct categorization
   - Proper severity assignment
   - Accurate reporting

2. Recovery Performance
   - < 10% error rate
   - > 95% recovery rate
   - < 1s response time
   - Minimal impact

3. System Stability
   - No cascading failures
   - Graceful degradation
   - Resource protection
   - Data consistency

## Usage

Run the simulation using the master runner:

```bash
python run_simulations.py --category data_processing --type error_handling
```

Or run directly:

```bash
python error_handling_test.py
```

## Reports

Reports are generated in JSON format and include:
- Error statistics
- Recovery metrics
- Performance data
- System recommendations

Reports are stored in:
```
.simulations/reports/data_processing/error_handling/
```
