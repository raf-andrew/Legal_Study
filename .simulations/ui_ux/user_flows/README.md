## Usage

Run the simulation using the master runner:

```bash
python run_simulations.py --category ui_ux --type user_flows
```

Or run directly:

```bash
python user_flows_test.py
```

## Reports

Reports are generated in JSON format and include:
- Flow metrics
- User metrics
- Error analysis
- Performance data
- UX recommendations

Reports are stored in:
```
.simulations/reports/ui_ux/user_flows/
```
