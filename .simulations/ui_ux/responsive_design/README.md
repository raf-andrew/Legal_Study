# Responsive Design Simulation

## Overview
This simulation evaluates the platform's responsive design capabilities, focusing on layout adaptation, content scaling, navigation patterns, and cross-device compatibility.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Layout Adaptation
- Breakpoint testing
- Grid system behavior
- Component positioning
- Spacing adjustments

### 2. Content Scaling
- Text scaling
- Image responsiveness
- Media queries
- Font adaptation

### 3. Navigation Patterns
- Menu behavior
- Touch interactions
- Gesture support
- Navigation flow

### 4. Cross-Device Testing
- Device emulation
- Orientation changes
- Screen size variations
- Input method adaptation

## Test Implementation
```python
def setup_responsive_test():
    """Initialize test environment for responsive design."""
    test_config = {
        "breakpoints": [...],
        "devices": [...],
        "content_types": [...],
        "interaction_patterns": [...]
    }
    return test_config

def execute_responsive_test(config):
    """Execute responsive design test scenarios."""
    results = {
        "layout_results": [],
        "content_results": [],
        "navigation_results": [],
        "device_results": []
    }
    return results

def analyze_responsive_results(results):
    """Analyze responsive design test results."""
    analysis = {
        "layout_metrics": {...},
        "content_metrics": {...},
        "navigation_metrics": {...},
        "device_metrics": {...}
    }
    return analysis
```

## Success Criteria
