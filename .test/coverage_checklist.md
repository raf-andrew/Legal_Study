# Test Coverage Checklist

## Coverage Requirements
- [x] Enable Xdebug coverage mode (phpunit.xml)
  - ✅ Configured in phpunit.xml with xdebug.mode=coverage
  - ✅ Verified with successful coverage report generation
  - ✅ Moved to .complete/xdebug_configuration_checklist.md
- [x] Configure PHPUnit for coverage reporting (phpunit.xml)
  - ✅ Coverage reports configured for Clover XML and HTML output
  - ✅ Text output enabled with uncovered files shown
  - ✅ All report types verified working
- [ ] Achieve 100% line coverage (Current: 24.22%)
- [ ] Achieve 100% method coverage (Current: 19.50%)
- [ ] Achieve 100% class coverage (Current: 0.00%)
