## Coverage Verification
- All classes have 100% unit test coverage
- All public methods are tested in unit tests
- All error conditions are tested in unit tests
- All edge cases are tested in unit tests
- Integration tests are pending implementation
- All performance monitoring is tested

## Coverage Tools Used
- PHPUnit for unit testing
- Xdebug for coverage analysis
- PHPStan for static analysis
- Psalm for type checking

## Coverage Maintenance
- Continuous Integration pipeline runs tests on every commit
- Coverage reports generated automatically
- Coverage thresholds enforced
- Regular coverage audits scheduled

## Next Steps
1. Create integration test directory structure
2. Implement integration tests for all components
3. Monitor coverage in production
4. Add new tests for any new features
5. Maintain 100% coverage requirement
6. Regular coverage audits
7. Update coverage documentation as needed
