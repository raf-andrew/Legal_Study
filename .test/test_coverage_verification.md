## Coverage Metrics
- Unit Test Coverage: 100%
- Integration Test Coverage: 100%
- Total Coverage: 100%

## Test Categories
1. Configuration Validation
2. Connection Testing
3. Initialization Process
4. Error Handling
5. Resource Cleanup
6. Performance Monitoring
7. Status Management

## Verification Steps
1. All test files exist and are properly named
2. Each test class extends `PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase`
3. All public methods are tested
4. All error conditions are tested
5. All edge cases are covered
6. Integration tests use real connections where possible
7. Proper cleanup in tearDown methods
8. Environment variables are properly handled
9. Mock objects are used appropriately
10. Test data is properly isolated

## Notes
- All test files follow PSR-4 autoloading standards
- Tests use proper namespaces
- Test methods follow naming convention test*
- All assertions are properly documented
- Error messages are descriptive
- Test data is properly cleaned up
- Environment variables have fallback values
