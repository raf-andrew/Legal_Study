        $this->generateTestReport($test, $result);
    }

    // Generate master report
    $this->generateMasterReport($results);

    // Generate coverage reports
    $this->generateCoverageReports();

    // Generate performance reports
    $this->generatePerformanceReports();
}
```

## Report Format
```php
// Example report format
protected function generateTestReport(string $test, array $result): void
{
    $report = [
        'test' => $test,
        'status' => $result['status'],
        'coverage' => [
            'lines' => $result['coverage']['lines'],

        ],
        'performance' => [
            'response_time' => $result['performance']['response_time'],
            'memory_usage' => $result['performance']['memory_usage'],
            'database_queries' => $result['performance']['database_queries'],
        ],
        'errors' => $result['errors'],
        'timestamp' => now()->toIso8601String(),
    ];

    file_put_contents(
