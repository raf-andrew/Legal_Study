# Security Infrastructure Guide

## Overview
The security infrastructure provides comprehensive protection for the project through code scanning, secret management, and security policies.

## Core Components

### Code Scanning
Code scanning is configured in [.github/security/code-scanning.yml](mdc:.github/security/code-scanning.yml) with:
- Static analysis
- Vulnerability detection
- Code quality checks
- Security best practices

### Secret Management
Secret scanning is managed in [.github/security/secret-scanning.yml](mdc:.github/security/secret-scanning.yml) providing:
- Secret detection
- Credential protection
- Access control
- Audit logging

### Security Policies
Security policies are defined in [.github/security/policies/](mdc:.github/security/policies) including:
- Access control
- Data protection
- Incident response
- Compliance requirements

## Security Features

### Code Protection
1. Static Analysis
   - Code quality
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Best practices
   - Performance issues

2. Dynamic Analysis
   - Runtime security
   - API security
   - Authentication
   - Authorization

### Secret Protection
1. Secret Detection
   - API keys
   - Credentials
   - Tokens
   - Certificates

2. Access Control
   - Role-based access
   - Permission management
   - Audit trails
   - Session control

## Security Workflows

### Scanning Workflows
1. Code Scanning
   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/code-scanning.yml
   name: Code Scanning
   on: [push, pull_request]
   jobs:
     scan:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - name: Run CodeQL Analysis
           uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
   ```

2. Secret Scanning
   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/secret-scanning.yml
   name: Secret Scanning
   on: [push, pull_request]
   jobs:
     scan:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - name: Run Secret Scanner
           uses: github/secret-scanning-action@v1
   ```

## Best Practices

### Code Security
1. Regular scanning
2. Vulnerability patching
3. Code review
4. Security testing
5. Documentation

### Secret Management
1. Use environment variables
2. Rotate secrets regularly
3. Limit access
4. Monitor usage
5. Audit logs

### Access Control
1. Principle of least privilege
2. Regular access review
3. Strong authentication
4. Session management
5. Audit logging

## Incident Response

### Response Plan
1. Detection
   - Monitor alerts
   - Analyze logs
   - Identify threats
   - Assess impact

2. Containment
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Block threats
   - Preserve evidence
   - Document actions

3. Recovery
   - Patch vulnerabilities
   - Restore systems
   - Verify security
   - Update policies

4. Prevention
   - Update security measures
   - Train team
   - Review procedures
   - Document lessons

## Compliance

### Security Standards
1. Code Standards
   - Secure coding
   - Code review
   - Testing requirements
   - Documentation

2. Access Standards
   - Authentication
   - Authorization
   - Session management
   - Audit requirements

3. Data Standards
   - Data protection
   - Privacy requirements
   - Storage security
   - Transmission security

## Monitoring

### Security Monitoring
1. Alert Management
   - Configure alerts
   - Set thresholds
   - Define responses
   - Track incidents

2. Log Analysis
   - Collect logs
   - Analyze patterns
   - Detect anomalies
   - Generate reports

3. Performance Monitoring
   - Track metrics
   - Identify issues
   - Optimize security
   - Report status
