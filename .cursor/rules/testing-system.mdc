# Testing System

- All feature tests are in `tests/Feature/`.
- The main test base class is `Tests\TestCase` (should bootstrap the Laravel app).
- Service management, health, and lifecycle are tested in:
  - [CodespacesServiceTest.php](mdc:tests/Feature/CodespacesServiceTest.php)
  - [CodespacesHealthTest.php](mdc:tests/Feature/CodespacesHealthTest.php)
  - [CodespacesLifecycleTest.php](mdc:tests/Feature/CodespacesLifecycleTest.php)
- Run tests with `php artisan test` for proper Laravel context.
- Test results and logs are typically stored in `.codespaces/verification/`, `.codespaces/complete/`, and `.codespaces/logs/`.

## Test Types

### Service Management Tests
[CodespacesServiceTest](mdc:tests/Feature/CodespacesServiceTest.php) verifies:
- Service configuration management
- Service enabling/disabling
- Configuration overrides
- Service state persistence

### Health Check Tests
[CodespacesHealthTest](mdc:tests/Feature/CodespacesHealthTest.php) verifies:
- Service health monitoring
- Health check logging
- Service verification
- Automatic rebuilding

### Lifecycle Tests
[CodespacesLifecycleTest](mdc:tests/Feature/CodespacesLifecycleTest.php) verifies:
- Service creation and teardown
- State persistence
- Service healing
- Configuration loading

## Test Cycle Runner
The [run_test_cycles.py](mdc:.codespaces/scripts/run_test_cycles.py) script:
- Runs multiple test cycles
- Performs health checks
- Saves test results
- Updates checklists

## Test Results
Test results are organized in:
- `.codespaces/verification/` - Current test results
- `.codespaces/complete/` - Completed test results
- `.codespaces/logs/` - Test execution logs

## Test Checklist
The [feature_tests.md](mdc:.codespaces/checklist/feature_tests.md) tracks:
- Completed test cycles
- Test results
- Health check status
- Service status

## Running Tests
Tests can be run using:
1. Individual test files: `php artisan test tests/Feature/CodespacesServiceTest.php`
2. All feature tests: `php artisan test tests/Feature`
3. Test cycles: `python .codespaces/scripts/run_test_cycles.py`

## Test Environment
The test environment:
- Uses Docker containers for services
- Maintains isolated test databases
- Provides clean state for each test
- Logs all test activities
