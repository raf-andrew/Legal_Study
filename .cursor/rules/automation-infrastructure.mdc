# Automation Infrastructure Guide

## Overview
The automation infrastructure provides tools and workflows for automating development, testing, and deployment processes.

## Core Components

### Workflow Automation
Workflows are configured in [.github/workflows/](mdc:.github/workflows) with:
- CI/CD pipelines
- Automated testing
- Deployment automation
- Maintenance tasks

### Issue Management
Issue automation is managed in [.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/](mdc:.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) providing:
- Issue templates
- Label automation
- Assignment rules
- Status tracking

### Pull Request Automation
PR automation is configured in [.github/pull_request_template.md](mdc:.github/pull_request_template.md) including:
- PR templates
- Review automation
- Merge rules
- Status checks

## Automation Features

### CI/CD Pipeline
1. Build Process
   - Code compilation
   - Dependency installation
   - Asset building
   - Version tagging

2. Test Process
   - Unit testing
   - Integration testing
   - End-to-end testing
   - Performance testing

3. Deployment Process
   - Environment setup
   - Configuration management
   - Service deployment
   - Health checks

### Issue Management
1. Issue Creation
   - Template selection
   - Field validation
   - Label assignment
   - Priority setting

2. Issue Tracking
   - Status updates
   - Progress tracking
   - Dependency management
   - Milestone tracking

3. Issue Resolution
   - Resolution verification
   - Documentation updates
   - Release notes
   - Knowledge base updates

## Automation Workflows

### CI/CD Workflow
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Build
        run: |
          npm install
          npm run build
      - name: Test
        run: npm test
      - name: Deploy
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        run: npm run deploy
```

### Issue Workflow
```yaml
# .github/workflows/issue-management.yml
name: Issue Management
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, labeled, unlabeled]
jobs:
  process:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Process Issue
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          script: |
            // Issue processing logic
```

## Best Practices
