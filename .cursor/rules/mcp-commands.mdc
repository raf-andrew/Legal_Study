# MCP Command Structure

The MCP server provides a set of artisan commands for managing and monitoring the platform. The main command implementations are located in the `src/Mcp/Console/Commands/` directory. Each command is paired with a corresponding test in `tests/Mcp/Console/Commands/` to ensure 100% coverage and reliability.

## Key Command Files
- [McpConfig.php](mdc:src/Mcp/Console/Commands/McpConfig.php): Configuration management (get, set, list, enable, disable, validate)
- [McpDatabase.php](mdc:src/Mcp/Console/Commands/McpDatabase.php): Database management and monitoring
- [McpGenerate.php](mdc:src/Mcp/Console/Commands/McpGenerate.php): Code generation
- [McpShell.php](mdc:src/Mcp/Console/Shell/McpShell.php): Interactive shell interface

## Test Coverage
- [McpConfigTest.php](mdc:tests/Mcp/Console/Commands/McpConfigTest.php)
- [McpDatabaseTest.php](mdc:tests/Mcp/Console/Commands/McpDatabaseTest.php)
- [McpGenerateTest.php](mdc:tests/Mcp/Console/Commands/McpGenerateTest.php)
- [McpShellTest.php](mdc:tests/Mcp/Console/Shell/McpShellTest.php)

All commands are registered in the [McpServiceProvider.php](mdc:src/Providers/McpServiceProvider.php) and are available when the application is running in console mode.
