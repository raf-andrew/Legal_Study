# Codespaces Workflow Guide

The Codespaces environment is managed through a series of PowerShell scripts that handle setup, testing, and monitoring.

## Main Workflow Script
The primary workflow is orchestrated by [full_simulation.ps1](mdc:.codespaces/scripts/full_simulation.ps1), which:
1. Sets up the environment
2. Starts all services
3. Runs the full simulation
4. Monitors the environment
5. Performs final health checks
6. Runs final tests

## Environment Setup
[setup_codespaces.ps1](mdc:.codespaces/scripts/setup_codespaces.ps1) handles initial environment setup:
- Creates necessary directories
- Sets up SQLite database
- Initializes checklist items
- Configures environment variables

## Service Management
[manage_codespaces.ps1](mdc:.codespaces/scripts/manage_codespaces.ps1) controls service lifecycle:
- Start/stop/restart services
- Verify service health
- Handle service dependencies

## Testing and Monitoring
[simulate_build.ps1](mdc:.codespaces/scripts/simulate_build.ps1) runs the full test suite:
- Database tests
- Cache tests
- Feature tests
- Health checks

[monitor_codespaces.ps1](mdc:.codespaces/scripts/monitor_codespaces.ps1) provides continuous monitoring:
- Service status checks
- Health check verification
- Failed test detection
- Automatic issue resolution

## Checklist Management
[update_checklist.ps1](mdc:.codespaces/scripts/update_checklist.ps1) tracks completion status:
- Updates item status
- Records completion files
- Maintains timestamps

## Docker Environment
The environment runs in Docker containers defined in [Dockerfile](mdc:.codespaces/Dockerfile):
- PHP 8.2 with FPM
- Required PHP extensions
- Redis support
- Composer for dependencies
