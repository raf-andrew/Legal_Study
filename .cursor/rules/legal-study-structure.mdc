# Legal Study Project Structure

This project is organized into a structured self-study framework for legal education. The main components are:

## Research Framework
The [.research/README.md](mdc:.research/README.md) serves as the master index for all research domains, including:
- Core Legal Knowledge
- Legal Skills
- Practice Areas
- Study Methodology
- Resource Evaluation

### Core Knowledge
Core legal subjects are documented in [.research/core_knowledge/criminal_law/homicide/README.md](mdc:.research/core_knowledge/criminal_law/homicide/README.md) which provides a template for organizing legal doctrine study.

## Testing Framework
The testing framework in [.tests/criminal_law/homicide_test.md](mdc:.tests/criminal_law/homicide_test.md) demonstrates the structure for:
- Multiple choice questions
- Essay questions
- Short answer questions
- Assessment criteria
- Grading rubrics

```

## Navigation Guidelines
1. Start with the master research index for domain overview
2. Follow subject-specific directories for detailed content
3. Reference test frameworks for assessment structure
4. Use job checklists for progress tracking
5. Consult QA guidelines for quality standards
