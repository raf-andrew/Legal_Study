# MCP Server API Routes

The main API routes for the MCP server are defined in [sniffing/mcp/server/routes.py](mdc:sniffing/mcp/server/routes.py).

## Overview
This file contains FastAPI route definitions for:
- **AI Service Endpoints**: Model listing, health, prompt processing, and metrics.
- **Error Handling Endpoints**: Logging, metrics, patterns, resolution, notifications, and error details.
- **Monitoring Endpoints**: System, application, performance, resource metrics, alert configuration, retention, and aggregation.

## Models
The following Pydantic models are defined for request/response validation:
- `AIModel`, `AIPrompt`, `AIResponse`
- `ErrorLog`, `AlertConfig`, `NotificationSettings`

## Referencing
Reference this file for all API route implementations, request/response models, and endpoint documentation related to AI, error handling, and monitoring in the MCP server.
