# Project Structure

- Main application code is in the `app` directory.
- Service providers are in `app/Providers/`.
- Service management logic is in `app/Services/`.
- Configuration is in the `config` directory.
- Feature and integration tests are in the `tests/Feature/` directory.
- Codespaces-specific service configs are in `.codespaces/services/`.
- Docker Compose and related infra are in `.codespaces/`.
- Routes are defined in `routes/web.php` and `routes/api.php`.

## Core Application Files
- Main application code is in the `app` directory
- Configuration files are in the `config` directory
- Tests are in the `tests` directory

## Codespaces Management
The `.codespaces` directory contains all Codespaces-specific files:

### Services
- Service configurations are stored in `.codespaces/services/`
- Each service has its own JSON configuration file (e.g., `mysql.json`, `redis.json`)
- Service states are tracked in `.codespaces/state/`

### Scripts
- Health check scripts in `.codespaces/scripts/health_check.py`
- Test cycle runner in `.codespaces/scripts/run_test_cycles.py`
- Environment setup scripts in `.codespaces/scripts/setup_environment.py`

### Documentation
- Service documentation in `.codespaces/docs/services/`
- Test documentation in `.codespaces/docs/tests/`

### Logs and Verification
- Service logs in `.codespaces/logs/`
- Test verification results in `.codespaces/verification/`
- Completed test results in `.codespaces/complete/`
