# Deployment Infrastructure Guide

## Overview
The deployment infrastructure manages the deployment of services and applications in GitHub Codespaces, providing tools for configuration, monitoring, and maintenance.

## Core Components

### Service Deployment
Service deployment is managed in [.setup/scripts/service_manager.py](mdc:.setup/scripts/service_manager.py) with:
- Service installation
- Service configuration
- Service control
- Health monitoring

### Environment Configuration
Environment setup is configured in [.devcontainer/devcontainer.json](mdc:.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) providing:
- Development environment
- Service configuration
- Port forwarding
- VS Code settings

### Log Management
Log handling is implemented in [.setup/scripts/tail_logs.py](mdc:.setup/scripts/tail_logs.py) including:
- Log monitoring
- Log rotation
- Error tracking
- Performance analysis

## Deployment Features

### Service Management
1. Installation
   - Package installation
   - Configuration setup
   - Service registration
   - Health verification

2. Configuration
   - Environment variables
   - Service settings
   - Network configuration
   - Security settings

3. Control
   - Start/stop services
   - Restart services
   - Status checking
   - Health monitoring

### Environment Setup
1. Development Environment
   - VS Code configuration
   - Extension installation
   - Workspace setup
   - Git configuration

2. Service Environment
   - MySQL setup
   - Redis setup
   - Port configuration
   - Security settings

## Deployment Workflows

### Service Deployment
```yaml
# .github/workflows/service-deployment.yml
name: Service Deployment
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Deploy Services
        run: |
          python .setup/scripts/service_manager.py --service mysql --action start
          python .setup/scripts/service_manager.py --service redis --action start
```

### Environment Setup
```yaml
# .devcontainer/devcontainer.json
{
  "name": "Development Environment",
  "dockerFile": "Dockerfile",
  "forwardPorts": [3306, 6379],
  "settings": {
    "terminal.integrated.shell.linux": "/bin/bash"
  },
  "extensions": [
    "ms-python.python",
    "ms-azuretools.vscode-docker"
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices

### Service Management
1. Version control
2. Configuration management
3. Health monitoring
4. Error handling
5. Documentation

### Environment Management
1. Consistent setup
2. Security first
3. Performance optimization
4. Regular updates
5. Backup procedures

### Log Management
1. Regular monitoring
2. Log rotation
3. Error tracking
4. Performance analysis
5. Security auditing

## Monitoring

### Service Monitoring
1. Health Checks
   - Service status
   - Resource usage
   - Error rates
   - Performance metrics

2. Log Analysis
   - Error patterns
   - Performance issues
   - Security events
   - Usage patterns

3. Resource Monitoring
   - CPU usage
   - Memory usage
   - Disk usage
   - Network traffic

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. Service Updates
   - Version updates
   - Security patches
   - Configuration updates
   - Performance optimization

2. Environment Updates
   - VS Code updates
   - Extension updates
   - Configuration updates
   - Security updates

3. Log Management
   - Log rotation
   - Archive management
   - Cleanup procedures
   - Backup verification

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
