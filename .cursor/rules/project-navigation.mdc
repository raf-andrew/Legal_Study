# Legal Education Project Navigation

This project follows a structured approach to self-directed legal education. The main components are organized as follows:

## Research and Documentation
The [.research/README.md](mdc:.research/README.md) serves as the master index for all study domains. Key areas include:
- Core legal knowledge
- Legal skills development
- Practice areas
- Study methodology

## Job Management
The [.jobs/README.md](mdc:.jobs/README.md) contains all task checklists and requirements. Jobs are tracked through:
- Active jobs
- Completed tasks
- Progress metrics
- Quality standards

## Quality Assurance
Quality standards are defined in [.qa/rubrics/README.md](mdc:.qa/rubrics/README.md) and include:
- Assessment rubrics
- Progress tracking
- Performance metrics
- Documentation standards

## Experimentation
Learning experiments are documented in [.experiments/README.md](mdc:.experiments/README.md) with:
- Learning methods
- Job completion
- Skill development
- Progress tracking

## Prompts System
Prompt templates are managed in [.prompts/README.md](mdc:.prompts/README.md) covering:
- Research development
- Job creation
- Learning materials
- Assessment tools

## Testing Framework
Tests are organized in [.tests/README.md](mdc:.tests/README.md) including:
- Knowledge assessment
- Skill evaluation
- Progress tracking
- Performance metrics

## Error Tracking
Errors and improvements are logged in [.errors/error_tracking.md](mdc:.errors/error_tracking.md) with:
- Error categories
- Analysis process
- Learning integration
- Quality improvement
