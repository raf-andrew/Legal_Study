## Navigation Guidelines

### Research Materials
- All research should be organized under `.research/`
- Each subject area should have its own subdirectory
- Include README.md in each directory for navigation
- Use tracking templates for progress monitoring
- Maintain quality standards documentation

### Job Management
- Active jobs in `.jobs/active/`
- Completed jobs moved to `.jobs/completed/`
- Each job must have:
  - execution.md
  - quality_checklist.md
  - breakdown.md
  - related prompts in `.prompts/`
  - tracking documentation
  - error logs if applicable

### Quality Assurance
- QA templates in `.qa/templates/`
- Active assessments in `.qa/active/`
- Each assessment linked to specific job or research item
- Regular quality reviews required
- Documentation standards enforced

### Prompt Management
- Organize prompts by category
- Include usage examples
- Document dependencies
- Track versions
- Maintain quality standards

### Error Tracking
- Use standardized error templates
- Document all issues
