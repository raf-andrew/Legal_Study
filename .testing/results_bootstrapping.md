## Test Information
- **Test ID**: BOOT-001
- **Test Name**: Environment Setup and Initialization
- **Date**: 2024-04-24
- **Environment**: Development
- **Tester**: QA System

## Test Details
- **Category**: Bootstrapping & Initialization
- **Priority**: High
- **Expected Duration**: 30 minutes
- **Actual Duration**: 15 minutes

## Test Steps
1. Verify environment setup
   - Check virtual environment creation
   - Verify dependencies installation
   - Validate environment variables
2. Database initialization
   - Test schema creation
   - Verify migration setup
   - Validate seed data loading
3. Application boot
   - Test service startup
   - Verify health checks
   - Validate configuration

## Expected Results

- All dependencies installed correctly
- Environment variables properly configured
- Database schema created and migrated
- Seed data loaded successfully
- Application starts without errors
- Health checks pass
- Configuration validated

## Actual Results
1. Environment Setup:
   - Virtual environment detected and working correctly
   - All dependencies installed successfully after resolving conflicts
   - Environment variables validated
2. Dependencies:
   - Base requirements installed
   - Development requirements installed
   - Test requirements installed
   - All dependency checks passing

## Observations
