## Action Plan
1. Add @covers annotations for InitializationStatus methods in each test method
2. Ensure proper assertions are in place
3. Verify test coverage after fixes

I want you to run analysis on existing infrastructure to determine what is already complete for that checklist item. Annotate the files that satisfy completion to the checklist. Annotate the test that confirms 100% functionality and completion to the checklist.

If any errors or failures are encountered create checklists in the .error and .failure folders to in turn go through and rectify before testing again. Work until all tests are satisfied, all errors cleared, all alerts cleared, then check the item off the list. Move on to the next item on the checklist.
If you complete a checklist you may move it to the .complete folder.
Work autonomously until a full checklist is complete before pausing for review or taking a break. Do not stop until a full checklist is complete and affirmed as described.ncountered create checklists in the .error and .failure folders to in turn go through and rectify before testing again.
