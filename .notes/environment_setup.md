# Environment Setup Notes

## Key Learnings
1. Python Installation
   - Windows Python installation can be tricky
   - PATH issues are common
   - Admin rights are crucial
   - Multiple Python versions can conflict

2. Virtual Environment
   - PowerShell execution policy affects scripts
   - venv needs proper Python installation
   - Activation script permissions matter
   - Clean environment is important

3. Dependencies
   - Requirements file needs careful curation
   - Version conflicts can occur
   - Some packages need system dependencies
   - Security updates are critical

4. Security
   - Environment variables need protection
   - Secrets should be generated securely
   - Dependencies need regular scanning
   - Permissions need careful management

## Common Issues
1. Python PATH
   - Not added during installation
   - Multiple Python versions
   - System vs. user installation
   - PowerShell vs. CMD behavior

2. Virtual Environment
   - Creation fails
   - Activation fails
   - Module not found errors
   - Permission denied errors

3. Dependencies
   - Installation fails
   - Version conflicts
   - Missing system libraries
   - Security vulnerabilities

4. Security
   - Weak secrets
   - Exposed credentials
   - Insecure permissions
   - Outdated dependencies
