# Testing Progress Notes

## Current Status
- Initial verification scripts created but failing
- Database experiment revealed connection handling issues
- Environment configuration needs validation
- Security hardening not yet started

## Immediate Tasks
1. Fix database connection handling in experiments
2. Complete environment verification
3. Implement security hardening
4. Set up smoke tests

## Progress by Category

### Environment Setup
- [x] Basic environment variables defined
- [ ] Environment validation script
- [ ] Development/production environment separation
- [ ] Logging configuration

### Database
- [x] Initial schema defined
- [x] ACID test experiment created
- [ ] Connection pooling implementation
- [ ] Migration system setup

### Security
- [ ] JWT configuration
- [ ] Password policy implementation
- [ ] Rate limiting setup
- [ ] CORS configuration

### Testing Infrastructure
- [x] Test directory structure
- [x] Basic test runner
- [ ] CI/CD integration
- [ ] Test coverage reporting

## Identified Issues
1. Database connection cleanup (see .errors/experiment_001.md)
2. Missing verification results (see .errors/verification_001.md)
3. Environment variable validation incomplete

## Next Steps
1. Implement proper connection pooling
2. Add retry mechanism for cleanup operations
3. Complete environment verification script
4. Begin security hardening process

## Notes for Improvement
- Need better error handling in database operations
- Should implement connection pooling
- Consider adding transaction isolation levels
- Add more comprehensive logging

## Dependencies to Add
- SQLAlchemy connection pooling
- pytest-retry for flaky tests
- pytest-timeout for hanging tests
- pytest-xdist for parallel testing
